Ethernet flow control disturbs the Ethernet class of service (defined in [IEEE 802.1p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1p "IEEE 802.1p")), as the data of all priorities are stopped to clear the existing buffers which might also consist of low priority data. As a remedy to this problem, [Cisco Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems "Cisco Systems") defined their own priority flow control extension to the standard protocol. This mechanism uses 14 bytes of the 42-byte padding in a regular pause frame. The MAC control opcode for a Priority pause frame is 0x0101. Unlike the original pause, Priority pause indicates the pause time in quanta for each of eight priority classes separately.[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_flow_control#cite_note-6) The extension was subsequently standardized by the Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) project authorized on March 27, 2008, as IEEE 802.1Qbb.[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_flow_control#cite_note-7) Draft 2.3 was proposed on June 7, 2010. Claudio DeSanti of Cisco was editor.[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_flow_control#cite_note-8) The effort was part of the [data center bridging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center_bridging "Data center bridging") task group, which developed [Fibre Channel over Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre_Channel_over_Ethernet "Fibre Channel over Ethernet").[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_flow_control#cite_note-9)
