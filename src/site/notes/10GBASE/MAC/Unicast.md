In [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), **unicast** is a [one-to-one transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_(communication) "One-to-one (communication)") from one point in the network to another point; that is, one sender and one receiver, each identified by a [network address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address "Network address").[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast#cite_note-1)

Unicast is in contrast to [[10GBASE/MAC/Multicast\|Multicast]] and [broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_(networking) "Broadcasting (networking)") which are one-to-many transmissions.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast#cite_note-2)
